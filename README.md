# About Me

My name is Kristina Mason (a.k.a. gjnmbm) and I am currently studying computer and electrical engineering.  

## Projects Kept on this site

This Github profile mostly houses partially completed or entirely completed projects I have worked on, most of them are kept in private repositories since they are most likely class assignments which shouldn't be made public to prevent copying.
